dev_add_datamodel(csv)
}
\arguments{
\item{csv}{The file path of a CSV file containing a datamodel CDM}
}
\description{
This function will assist in adding a new supported datamodel to
ReviewR. A CDM file, stored as a CSV will be added to the
namespace, such that the CDM can be identified by the datamodel
detection module. Additionally, a database_tables.R file will
be created and opened in R/ with basic table skeletons created
based on the CDM stored in the user supplied CSV.
