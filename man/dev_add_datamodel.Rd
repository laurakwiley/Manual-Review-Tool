This function will assist in adding a new supported data model to
ReviewR. A schema file, stored as a CSV will be added to the
namespace, such that the database can be identified by the data model
detection module. Additionally, a database_tables.R file will
be created and opened in R/ with basic table skeletons created
based on the schema stored in the user supplied CSV.
