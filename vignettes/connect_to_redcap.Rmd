## Getting Started

In order to collect and store information about patients, you'll want to connect ReviewR with a REDCap Project that has been previously created and approved by your institution for use with your data. Data abstraction in ReviewR is handled by the [shinyREDCap](https://shinyredcap.thewileylab.org/) module, which is responsible for translating REDCap project fields to native R Shiny controls and storing data in your REDCap Project. 

### Create a REDCap Project

To begin, create a REDCap project on your institution's REDCap instance. Add any users that you would like to be able to access this project, and ensure that their permissions include:

* Data Export Tool: Full Data Set
* API: Import
* API: Export
* Create Records

Once users have been added and permissions set, have users log into the project, and request API access to the project. Users will need an API key to access the abstraction functionality of ReviewR. API keys are assigned to individuals and it is imperative that each individual performing review activities has their own API key.

### Design Instruments

After your project has been initialized with users added and API keys have been provisioned, you'll have to design some instruments for your REDCap project with a few considerations. 

#### Supported Field Types
Importantly, you'll have to use supported field types when creating your instruments. Currently, `shinyREDCap` supports the following REDCap project field types:
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(gt)
shinyREDCap::redcap_widget_map %>% 
  mutate(class = case_when(redcap_field_type %in% c('text', 'notes') ~ 'Text Field',
                           redcap_field_type %in% c('dropdown', 'radio') ~ 'Single Answer',
                           redcap_field_type %in% c('checkbox') ~ 'Multiple Answer',
                           redcap_field_type %in% c('yesno', 'truefalse') ~ 'Logical',
                           TRUE ~ 'Other')
         ) %>% 
  select('REDCap Field Type' = redcap_field_type, 'REDCap Field Validation' = redcap_field_val, class, -shinyREDCap_widget_function) %>% 
  # group_by(class) %>%
  gt(groupname_col = 'class') %>% 
  tab_header(title = md('**Supported Project Fields**'),
             subtitle = md('REDCap Question types that translate to native shiny controls.')) %>%
  tab_source_note(md('*Source*: [REDCap Project Field Types](https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/consortium/videoplayer.php?video=field_types02.mp4&title=REDCap%20Project%20Field%20Types&referer=redcap.ucdenver.edu)')) %>% 
  gt::opt_row_striping(TRUE) %>% 
  row_group_order(groups = c("Text Field", "Single Answer", "Multiple Answer", "Logical"))
  
```

#### Fields to Include

When designing your instrument(s), be sure to include the following fields:

* *Patient Identifier*: This is the stable identifier associated with each unique subject in your dataset (ex MRN)
* *Reviewer name*: Optionally, provide a field for reviewer's to enter their name. In this way, multiple reviewers can store their own abstraction information for each subject in the connected dataset.

As long as these fields are present, ReviewR will automatically populate them with the correct information when configured.

#### Not Supported

At this time, longitudinal studies and instruments using conditional logic are not supported. 

## Get Connected

Once you have set up your REDCap project as defined above, you are ready to connect to it from ReviewR. Load ReviewR either by visiting your institution's deployed URL, or by running `ReviewR::run_app()` from your local R installation. Head to the setup tab and connect to your patient data, using the 'Connect to Patient Database' pane. 

### Connect to REDCap Project

You are now ready to connect to REDCap. From the 'Configure Patient Chart Abstraction' pane, select 'REDCap' from the Abstraction Module drop down. Next, enter your institution's REDCap API URL, and REDCap API key that was created for your REDCap project.

```{r figure_1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="*Add REDCap Connection information.*", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('redcap_connect.png')
```
After entering this information, click the 'Connect to REDCap' button. Note that the connect button will only appear after both a URL and API key are supplied. If the connection is successful, information about the connected project will be displayed including:

* REDCap Project ID
* Project creation date
* Production status

### Configure REDCap

Once a successful connection is made to a REDCap project a 'Configure REDCap' dialogue will appear. Here is where we will select the REDCap Question that will hold patient identifier. Additionally, if configured in your REDCap project, select which field should contain your reviewer information. 

One these fields are set, ReviewR will see if any information has been entered into the project. If previous information is found with a reviewer associated, it will populate a drop down with reviewers that may be selected. 

```{r figure_2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="*Select from available reviewers.*", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('redcap_select_reviewer.png')
```

If no previous information has been entered, or you would like to add a new reviewer, you may type a new name, and click 'Add'
```{r figure_3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="*Add a new reviewer.*", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('redcap_add_reviewer.png')
```

Once valid configuration selections have been chosen the 'Configure REDCap' button will appear. Click 'Configure REDCap' to save configuration values. Configured options will be presented for review. Upon successful configuration, review in progress status and your REDCap instrument will appear in ReviewR and you may now begin your manual record review. 
```{r figure_4, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="*Review selections when configured*", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('redcap_configure_success.png')
```

## Disconnect/Reconfigure

At any point during the setup process, you may click 'Disconnect' to connect to a different REDCap project, or 'Reconfigure REDCap' to set new configuration options.
