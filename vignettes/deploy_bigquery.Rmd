## Overview

In order to protect your privacy, Google has specific requirements for connecting and allowing applications to access your data. These requirements mean that there are some things you should know, and in server deployments some extra setup steps required, for projects connecting to Google BigQuery.

## Local Deployment

You should be able to use ReviewR locally to connect to Google BigQuery as expected. However you will likely see a notice that our app is not yet verified. You can see our full [privacy policy](https://www.thewileylab.org/privacypolicy) for how we handle your data (briefly, we only collect aggregate usage information, none of your data sets are revealed or accessible to us). If those terms are acceptable for you, please select `Advanced` and then `Go to The Wiley Lab (unsafe)` to approve access to your data for use in ReviewR. 

It is also possible for you to obtain and provide your own Google API credentials so that you do not need to use the Wiley Lab OAuth Client. To do so:

1. Obtain a Google Cloud Platform Project
    + https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create an OAuth clientID and secret
    + Within the project you created in step 1, head to *APIs & Services > Credentials*
    + At the top, click *Create credentials > OAuth client ID*
    + Select "Web application" as the application type
      + Optionally, provide a name for your web application client
    + Add the https URL of your shiny server ReviewR installation to the Authorized redirect URIs section *eg: https://your.shinyserver.org/ReviewR*
    + Click *Create*
3. Locate the client ID that was created and click "Download JSON"
    + Save the file as "client_secret.json"

************FILL IN************************


## Server Deployment

Due to how Google OAuth clientIDs are configured, if you are using a server deployment of ReviewR that connects to data stored in Google BigQuery, you must obtain and provide your own Google API credentials. After ReviewR is installed and accessible on a server with a secured fully qualified domain name, then: 

1. Obtain a Google Cloud Platform Project
    + https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create an OAuth clientID and secret
    + Within the project you created in step 1, head to *APIs & Services > Credentials*
    + At the top, click *Create credentials > OAuth client ID*
    + Select "Web application" as the application type
      + Optionally, provide a name for your web application client
    + Add the https URL of your shiny server ReviewR installation to the Authorized redirect URIs section *eg: https://your.shinyserver.org/ReviewR*
    + Click *Create*
3. Locate the client ID that was created and click "Download JSON"
    + Save the file as "client_secret.json"
4. Upload this file to the following directory on your shiny server:
    + `/srv/shiny-server/.shinyBigQuery`
5. If ReviewR is already installed, simply refresh the browser window.
