## Overview

Now that we have connected to patient records and established a REDCap project and connection, we can begin our chart review. To review previous setup steps, please see: 

* `vignette('connect_to_patient_records')`
* `vignette('connect_to_redcap')`

## Patient Search

Begin by opening the 'Patient Search' section and identifying a patient to review. To locate a particular patient you may search by any of the available fields by entering a search term in the box at the top of each column, or search globally across all columns by utilizing the search box in the upper right. The right most columns indicate the review status of each individual in the connected dataset. As you review subjects and upload information to REDCap, or other project users complete reviews, these columns will update indicating the current review status of each subject. Once you have selected a patient of interest, click the subject ID to be taken to the 'Chart Review' section.

```{r figure_1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "*Patient Tab displaying a [50 person subset](https://github.com/thewileylab/synPUF) of the CMS 2008-2010 Data Entrepreneursâ€™ Synthetic Public Use File (DE-SynPUF) from OHDSI.*", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('reviewr_pt_search.png')
```

## Chart Review

Clicking a subject ID from the 'Patient Search' page will automatically redirect you to the 'Chart Review' portion of ReviewR. Here, you will be greeted by a screen similar to this:

```{r figure_2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "*ReviewR Chart Review: Everything's [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), Cap'n. Not to fret.*"}
knitr::include_graphics('reviewr_chart_review.png')
```

Note that the 'Chart Review' page consists of 4 elements, which will be discussed below. 

### Subject Header

The Subject header contains demographic information about your selected subject, in context and takes up the upper left portion of the 'Chart Review' page. This information is extracted directly from the 'Patient Chart' tab and will give you a quick reference to demographic information about your patient. When configured, review status will also be available in this pane.

Your saved review status for the particular subject in context will appear next to the subject ID with a visual indicator:

* blank: Review Not Started
* red: 'Incomplete'
* yellow: 'Unverified'
* green: 'Complete'

Whereas the status assigned by other reviewers will appear in the right most column of demographic information in the subject header.

### Jump to Subject ID

This dropdown contains a listing of all of the subjects in your connected dataset, along with the review status you have assigned, if present. It allows you to review subjects in any order. s

### Patient Chart

The patient chart occupies the lower left portion of the screen. This tabbed panel contains all of the patient tables that have been defined for a particular data model. Access each table by clicking the tab at the top of this pane. Search within table fields by entering a search term or regex string in the search box located at the top of each table column. You may also enter a 'global search' term in the box located in the upper right portion of this pane. Global search applies the search string or regular expression to every field of every connected table, and highlights any results that are found.
